## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learn about centering texts next to images and align them to the center of that element that's next to it.
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.author p {
  display: inline;
  vertical-align: middle;
}
```

### Continued development

I'd like to keep enhancing my skills to center elements and specially to position them in the place I need them, or in the place the project mark they need to exist in the page.
